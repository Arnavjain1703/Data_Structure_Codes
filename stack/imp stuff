empty() – Returns whether the stack is empty – Time Complexity : O(1) 
size() – Returns the size of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1) 
top() – Returns a reference to the top most element of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1) 
push(g) – Adds the element ‘g’ at the top of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1) 
pop() – Deletes the top most element of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1) 

Popping an element from a stack will take O(1) time complexity. Popping the last element in a stack will take O(n).
