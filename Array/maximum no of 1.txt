Given a binary array arr of size N and an integer M. Find the maximum number of consecutive 1's produced by flipping at most M 0's.
 

Example 1

Input
N = 3
arr[] = {1, 0, 1}
M = 1
Output
3
Explanation
Maximum subarray is of size 3
which can be made subarray of all 1 after
flipping two zeros to 1.
