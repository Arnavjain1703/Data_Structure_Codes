Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 of size M and N respectively and an element K. The task is to find the element that would be at the k’th position of the final sorted array.
 

Example 1:

Input:
arr1[] = {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
arr2[] = {1, 4, 8, 10}
k = 5
Output:
6
Explanation:
The final sorted array would be -
