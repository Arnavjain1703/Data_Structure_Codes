Given an array of size N, find the smallest positive integer value that cannot be represented as sum of some elements from the array.


Example 1:

Input: 
N = 6
array[] = {1, 10, 3, 11, 6, 15}
Output: 
2
Explanation:
2 is the smallest integer value that cannot 
be represented as sum of elements from the array.


long long smallestpositive(vector<long long> array, int n)
    { 
       sort(array.begin(),array.end());
       long long z=1;
       for(long long i=0;i<n && array[i]<=z;i++)
       {
           z=z+array[i];
       }
       return z;
    }
